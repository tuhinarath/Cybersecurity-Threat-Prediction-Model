# Cybersecurity Threat Prediction System

## Overview
This project is an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that classifies network traffic as normal or an attack using machine learning.

## Features
- Uses **Random Forest Classifier** for basic threat detection.
- Detects attacks based on traffic speed and packet size.
- Provides accuracy metrics.

## Installation
Run the following to install dependencies:

pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy

## Usage
Run the script:

python ids_model.py


## Next Steps
- Improve model with real datasets.
- Add cloud-based deployment.
